<div id="excerpt">
      As a news reporter and editor for the Daily Californian, the independent fully student-run newspaper of the UC Berkeley campus and local city,
      I gained a truly unique perspective of Berkeley outside of our campus bubbles.
      Whether it was about a campus professor's latest breakthrough in research or a city council meeting,
      each news article came with all these different stories that I was charged with bringing together and framing.
